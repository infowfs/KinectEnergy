# Dynamic Block

Dymamic block is a component that allows users to call content to be displayed in a pre defined view. That said, this component is a view or a wrap to display content types created with: _generic details, events, media, etc_.

Let's say you want to add a dynamic block to a page in order to display the upcoming events. In this case, all you have to do is:

1. **Add a dynamic block**
2. **Select the view Event block**

You'll get something like this:
