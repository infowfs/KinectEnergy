# Iframe Content

The **Iframe** paragraph allows you to embed an HTML document or element within a Standard Content Page \(or any of the other content types available under the "Use Case" section below\).

It's the wrap from where you can showcase different components and content types already created, e.g.: a map, a list of generic details, files, etc. This means that an Iframe can have a different aspect depending on the information that it's being displayed.
