# Map Location content type

**Map Location c**ontent type allows editors to create a sort of _virtual business card_ for each location. It features key contact information like telephone or email, but also the exact address that will be displayed on the map. 

This is the information that will be displayed by using the ****[**Map Location paragraph**](../paragraphs/map-location.md), so before using the Map Location paragraph, be sure you have already created the Map Location content type that we're about to describe.
